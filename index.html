                A year before the MoMA exhibition, Superstudio dreamed up the 2000-Ton City. The citizens of this
                megastructure
                live in a techno-utopia in which all their desires are fulfilled, unless they entertain any idea of dissent,
                in
                which case their ceiling will come down on them with the weight of two thousand tons. As we noted earlier,
                the
                smart home is made for black humor and dystopian fantasy.
            </p>
            <div class="img2"><img src="image/img2.png"/></div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="text1">
            <div class="img2"><img src="image/img3.png"/></div>
            <p>
                In fact, the smart home is far from dramatic. Unlike Superstudio’s modernism ad absurdum or even the very
                Fifties-ish capsule of Alison and Peter Smithson’s House of
                the Future, the smart home is utterly prosaic in its appearance.

            It may look no different than your home or mine. When Time magazine put “The Smarter Home” on its cover last
            year (“The dwellings of the future will make
            you calmer, safer, richer and healthier”), it chose a cheap-looking, suburban cookie-cutter house. (It may
            well
            be that the absence of a pitched roof and the addition of a climbing wall were indicators of the height of
            innovation, but such subtleties are difficult for a European to read.)
            This was very shrewd of Time. Because if the smart home is to become a reality, it will have to adapt itself
            to the majority of existing homes or be
            doomed to a tiny market of wealthy eccentrics.
